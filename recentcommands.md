This is roughly 3~ hours of work. At some point I had technical issues and had to restart the command line. I was frustrated. As shown by the multiple attempts to log in.
I had gotten to one point and then the command line had just gone blank and would not accept anything. Great. So I took a moment and just restarted.
The only other issue I had in this half of part 4 was really understanding what information to use. As well as realising that I had no control over the acceptance of the pull as it was
not my repo and there are privacy settings. At first I was pretty confused as to what I was doing and why, but the more I did the more I got the hang of it, and the
more that I started to understand what I was doing. It started to feel like I was a real coder! Understanding lines of jibberish and everything! Almost.
