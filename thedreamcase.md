In the Epigraphic Database Heidelberg I searched for fligina, but I have not studied latin, so I was more interested in the Commwealth War Graves Commission. There I searched
For the surname 'Finney'(https://www.cwgc.org/search-results?term=finney&name=finney&fullname=finney&tab=wardead) and got 150 results that I downloaded and saved to my computer.
