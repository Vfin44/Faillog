# Faillog for Module 1

Excersize one and two went by relitivly easy for me, no main problems. I had forgotten some passwords, and was not 100% sure on what I had really done and why, but I did it!
GitHub scared me, so I was in turn looking forward to exercise 3, but also dreading it. After making the first repository, it was was less scary, and I started to have fun.
It took me a little bit after doing the $ git init and getting the message Initialized empty Git repository in /home/demonstration/first-repo/.git/ to realise that this did
not mean that it was now in my GitHub. I mean, I should have realised that was not possible.
I had an ungodly amound of Issues with the $ git config --global user.email "you\@example.com" and the $ git config --global user.name "Your Name". I forgot the " at the end and
then it went blank and I tried again, and then again, and then the command line came back, then I was like 'hey I fixed it!' but later I realised nope, I didn't just gave
myself a really long email. so I fixed it, but only for half of my commits. I also had a lot of fun adding the commits and files, but spent some time frustrated befor realising 
I forgot the git add -A command.

I had a hard time with the command line crashing on me and not working. Next week I am going to save my history more often and take better notes.
